<analysis>
The previous AI engineer successfully executed a comprehensive cleanup task on an existing full-stack application. Initially, the engineer identified a discrepancy between the stated goal (removing Python/MongoDB) and the actual pre-existing state (already migrated to Node.js/Supabase). After clarifying with the user, the core task became removing all lingering references to the old FastAPI/MongoDB infrastructure and updating configuration and documentation.

The engineer methodically addressed this by:
1.  Verifying current environment variables.
2.  Updating .
3.  Searching for and updating old references in documentation files (, , , ).
4.  Crucially, identifying and fixing the supervisor configuration () which was still attempting to run the old backend, leading to startup errors and port conflicts.
5.  Troubleshooting Node.js backend startup issues, including a module not found error (resolved by yarn install v1.22.22

6.  Verifying the backend and database connection post-fixes.

The task was completed with thorough verification, ensuring the application now exclusively uses Node.js, React, and Supabase, with all legacy traces removed.

<product_requirements>
The product is a full-stack application, previously migrated from a Python/FastAPI/MongoDB stack to a Node.js/React/Supabase (PostgreSQL + Authentication) architecture. The application currently functions as a video slideshow generator, thread maker with OpenAI integration, and includes user management.

The explicit request from the user was to:
1.  Remove any remaining references to the old Python/FastAPI/MongoDB infrastructure, especially within configuration files like , documentation, and supervisor configurations.
2.  Ensure all system configurations and code snippets correctly reflect the current Node.js + Supabase architecture.
3.  Confirm that API keys are correctly updated and utilized by the new infrastructure.

The core problem was inconsistency between the operational stack and outdated configuration/documentation, potentially causing confusion or issues. The goal was to fully align the codebase and deployment setup with the new Node.js/Supabase environment, ensuring no legacy components or references remain.

<key_technical_concepts>

*   **Node.js (Express)**: Primary backend framework.
*   **React**: Frontend framework.
*   **Supabase**: Database (PostgreSQL) and authentication service.
*   **FastAPI / MongoDB**: Legacy backend/database, targeted for removal/cleanup.
*   **Supervisor**: Process control system for managing backend and frontend services.
*   **Kubernetes Ingress**: Manages routing with  prefix for backend.
*   **OpenAI API**: Integrated for AI functionalities (e.g., thread creation).
*   **Remotion**: Used for video generation.

<code_architecture>
The application has a standard full-stack structure with separate frontend and backend directories.



-   **/app/test_result.md**:
    -   **Importance**: Contains the initial user problem statement, testing protocols, and a log of previous agent communications and test results. It was crucial for the AI engineer to understand the application's history and current status.
    -   **Changes Made**: Initially read to understand the project. Later, all old MongoDB references within its comments were cleaned up to reflect the successful migration.

-   **/app/.emergent/emergent.yml**:
    -   **Importance**: This file defined the environment image name used for deployment. It still referenced an old .
    -   **Changes Made**: The  was updated from  to , reflecting the new architecture.

-   **/app/node-backend/.env**:
    -   **Importance**: Contains environment variables critical for the Node.js backend, including , , , and .
    -   **Changes Made**: The file was read to verify that the API keys were correctly updated as per the user's implicit request, confirming they were already in place. No direct changes were made by the AI engineer during this trajectory.

-   **/app/README.md**, **/app/PROJECT_STRUCTURE.md**, **/app/FIXES_SUMMARY.md**:
    -   **Importance**: These are documentation files describing the project, its structure, and a summary of previous fixes. They contained outdated references to FastAPI/MongoDB.
    -   **Changes Made**: All occurrences of fastapi, mongodb, mongo, python backend, and uvicorn were replaced or updated to correctly describe the Node.js + Supabase architecture.

-   **/etc/supervisor/conf.d/supervisord.conf**:
    -   **Importance**: This configuration file dictates how system services (backend, frontend, MongoDB) are managed by Supervisor. It was still configured to run a Python backend and a MongoDB instance.
    -   **Changes Made**: The  section was updated to point to the  file and use  as the command. The  section was entirely removed. This was a critical fix to ensure the correct backend started and to eliminate the legacy database.

-   **/app/node-backend/src/server.js**:
    -   **Importance**: The main entry point for the Node.js Express backend.
    -   **Changes Made**: The file was inspected to confirm it was not using MongoDB-related code. No modifications were necessary as it was already using Supabase.

-   **/app/node-backend/src/config/database.js**:
    -   **Importance**: Handles the database connection logic for the Node.js backend.
    -   **Changes Made**: Inspected to verify that it correctly uses  from  and contains  and  exports, confirming its exclusive Supabase usage. No modifications were necessary.

-   **/app/node-backend/package.json**:
    -   **Importance**: Defines the Node.js project's dependencies and scripts.
    -   **Changes Made**: Inspected to check for required dependencies when a module not found error occurred. yarn install v1.22.22

<current_work>
The previous AI engineer meticulously completed the task of cleaning up all legacy references to the old Python/FastAPI/MongoDB infrastructure and ensuring the application runs entirely on the new Node.js/React/Supabase stack.

Key accomplishments and current state:
*   **Infrastructure Alignment**: All documentation files (, , , ) and the  configuration now correctly reflect the Node.js Express backend and Supabase PostgreSQL database setup.
*   **Backend Migration Validation**: The Node.js backend was confirmed to be exclusively using Supabase for database operations, with all MongoDB-related code and configurations purged.
*   **Service Operational Status**: Both the Node.js backend (running on port 8001) and the React frontend (running on port 3000) are fully operational. This required troubleshooting and fixing the Supervisor configuration to correctly launch the Node.js backend and remove the MongoDB service, as well as resolving a module dependency issue and a port conflict.
*   **API Key Configuration**: The necessary API keys for OpenAI and Supabase are present and correctly configured in the  files.
*   **Functionality**: The application retains its core features including video slideshow generation (via Remotion), thread making with OpenAI integration, and user management with Supabase authentication.
*   **Database Verification**: Connectivity to Supabase PostgreSQL was confirmed, and data (e.g., 17 video records via  endpoint) is being successfully retrieved, validating the database integration.

In summary, the application is now stable, consistent, and running purely on the intended Node.js, React, and Supabase architecture.
